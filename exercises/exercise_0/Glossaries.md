| RDBMS | “Relational Database Management System”. A database management system that stores data in a structured format using tables with rows and columns, following the relational model. |
| relational model | A way of structuring data using relations (tables), where each relation consists of tuples (rows) and attributes (columns) |
| conceptual model | A high-level, abstract representation of the data and its relationships, often created using ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams) |
| logical model | A detailed representation of the data, showing tables, attributes, relationships, and constraints, independent of a specific database system. |
| physical model | The implementation of a database on a specific database management system, defining storage structures, indexing and performance considerations. |
| ERD | Entity-Relationship Diagram - A visual representation of entities, attributes and relationships in a database, used in the conceptual modeling phase. |
| data modeling | The process of creating a conceptual, logical and physical model of data to ensure it is structured and efficiently managed. |
| data integrity | The accuracy, consistency and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle, maintained through constraints and validation rules. |
| data consistency | Ensuring that data remains uniform and does not contradict itself across different tables or databases. |
| field | A single piece of data within a record, also known as a column in a relational database. |
| attribute | A property or characteristic of an entity in a database, typically represented as a column in a table.  |
| data type | The classification of data (integer, varchar, date) that defines the kind of values an attribute can store. |
| tuple | A single row or record in a table, representing one instance of an entity. |
| data redundancy | The unnecessary duplication of data within a database, which can lead to inconsistencies and increased storage requirements. |
| transaction | A sequence of operations performed as a single unit of work, ensuring ACID properties.(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) |
| cardinality | The number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity in a relationship. |
| one-to-one | A type of relationship where one record in a table is associated with only one record in another table. |
| one-to-many | A type of relationship where one record in a table is associated with multiple records in another table. |
| many-to-many | A type of relationship where multiple records in one table as associated with multiple records in another table. This is typically implemented using a junction (bridge) table that contains foreign keys referencing both related tables. |
