Organizing data to different normal forms

- first normal form
- second normal form
- third normal form
- boyce-codd normal form
- fourth normal form
- fifth normal form
- sixth normal form

In most cases 3NF is already good enough generally for designing databases.

## 1NF 2NF 3NF

**first normal form**
- row order doesn't matter
- Primary Key in each table
- no repeating groups
- uniform column data

**second normal form**
- 1NF
- non prime attributes, must be functionally dependent on entire pk and not just part of it

**third normal form**
- 2NF
- non prime attributes depends on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key
